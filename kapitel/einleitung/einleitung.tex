\section{Problem of the Thesis and Scientific Question}
Current relational databases go far beyond the transactional processing of data with their functionalities. One of these functionalities is the possibility of a full-text search over data. For this full-text search, powerful extensions of the database query language (SQL) are available, which generate complex query terms by an extensive combination of operators. The goal of this thesis is to generate query terms for the database based on a search engine-like input. The starting point for the input can be e.g. the search operators of Google.\\
The scientific question may be defined as: In what way can a software component be developed using a custom query language and interpreter to enable full-text search on Microsoft SQL servers?
