\section{Literature}
The core of my literature will be "Pro full-text search in SQL Server 2008" by Michael Coles and "Crafting interpreters" by Robert Nystrom, which define the most important elements of full-text search and interpreter development. In addition, I will refer to articles from projects similar to mine and review their approach and sources for my purposes. Articles I have found recently on this topic are several projects by Holger and Hannah Bast, who have developed tools to assist in full-text search.
\section{Working Title}
The title of my thesis is "Development of a Query Language for Full-Text Search in Relational Databases".
\section{Objective / Expected Result }
The objective of my thesis should be an artifact that allows you to define certain search criteria in a search box on a website. These search criteria should enable functions of the full-text search, e.g. reflections and phrase-based search. From this, appropriate SQL code is generated and applied to a Microsoft SQL server. As a result, tuples of server content are to be displayed that match the search query, e.g. excerpts from Word documents or pdfs.
