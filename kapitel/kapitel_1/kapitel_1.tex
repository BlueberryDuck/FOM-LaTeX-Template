\section{Initial Situation and Classification in the Existing Research}
What is the scientific environment of the topic? In which larger context/question would you place the topic?

The environment of grammar design, interpreters and basic understanding of full-text search.

Why is the topic relevant? From what do you deduce that your question is relevant? Who might have an interest in or benefit from the results?

With options such as word and phrase-based searches and the ability to index documents in their native formats for example Office documents and PDFs, full-text search functionality is an increasingly important function in modern databases and document management systems. Being able to operate such a mighty feature with an easy-to-understand grammar instead of learning SQL is just one example of why custom languages generating code are getting in higher demand.

What is already available? What has already been tried?

There are many examples of code generators to either make writing code more accessible or assist experienced developers. This specific example of full-text search is often used in a simplified way by search engines.
\section{Approach and Methodology}
Do you want to collect data independently (empirical research) or rely on existing data/literature?

Rely on existing literature for concepts and try to implement them. (Prototype implementation)
