\section{Theory}
The query language to be developed can be classified as a \ac{DSL} since it is designed specifically for full-text search to simplify the search process. Therefore, in chapter \ref{sec:dsl} \ac{DSL}s are illustrated in greater detail.\\
The development of a query language also entails the design of the language itself. How this is done is described in chapter \ref{sec:design}. The notation used for writing down the design choices is also discussed.\\
The technical part of the development, a code generator, is addressed in chapter \ref{sec:code-gen} to specify common components and procedures.\\
Since the goal is to simplify the use of full-text search on \ac{SQL} servers, chapter \ref{sec:fulltext} explains how such a server is structured, and what the full-text search capabilities entail.
