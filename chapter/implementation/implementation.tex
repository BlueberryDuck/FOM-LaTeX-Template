\section{Implementation}
When using the full-text search, large parts of the \ac{SQL} statements needed to describe the search are the same, since the search criteria are defined as either WHERE conditions or JOIN criteria. To define a full-text search, usually use a combination of the given functions is used. In \ac{TSQL} this would be for example CONTAINS or FORMSOF. Therefore the goal is to develop a query language where only a combination of functions and a few parameters is necessary to generate the corresponding \ac{TSQL}.
