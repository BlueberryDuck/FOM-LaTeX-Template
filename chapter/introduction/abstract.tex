To use full-text search functionalities the relevant SQL syntax must be known to build a complex statement to formulate a mostly simple search request.
Code generators, in conjunction with a graphical user interface or DSL, make powerful tools such as full-text search more accessible, enabling individuals and companies with little IT knowledge to use them.
The objective of the thesis is a software component, including a code generator and custom query language, to define search criteria that enable full-text search.
To achieve this, a prototype is developed that practically implements the concepts of compiler construction.
The most important finding was the division of the prototype into modules, which can function more or less independently of each other.
Thus, different approaches for the individual modules could be tried out and improvements can be made relatively easily.
