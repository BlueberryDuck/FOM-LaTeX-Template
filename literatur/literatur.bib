	abstract = {In this paper we present a novel index data structure tailored towards semantic full-text search. Semantic full-text search, as we call it, deeply integrates keyword-based full-text search with structured search in ontologies. Queries are SPARQL-like, with additional relations for specifying word-entity co-occurrences. In order to build such queries the user needs to be guided. We believe that incremental query construction with context-sensitive suggestions in every step serves that purpose well. Our index has to answer queries and provide such suggestions in real time. We achieve this through a novel kind of posting lists and query processing, avoiding very long (intermediate) result lists and expensive (non-local) operations on these lists. In an evaluation of 8000 queries on the full English Wikipedia (40 GB XML dump) and the YAGO ontology (26.6 million facts), we achieve average query and suggestion times of around 150ms.},

	shorttitle = {Broccoli},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2615},
	abstract = {We present Broccoli, a fast and easy-to-use search engine for what we call semantic full-text search. Semantic full-text search combines the capabilities of standard full-text search and ontology search. The search operates on four kinds of objects: ordinary words (e.g., edible), classes (e.g., plants), instances (e.g., Broccoli), and relations (e.g., occurs-with or native-to). Queries are trees, where nodes are arbitrary bags of these objects, and arcs are relations. The user interface guides the user in incrementally constructing such trees by instant (search-as-you-type) suggestions of words, classes, instances, or relations that lead to good hits. Both standard full-text search and pure ontology search are included as special cases. In this paper, we describe the query language of Broccoli, the main idea behind a new kind of index that enables fast processing of queries from that language as well as fast query suggestion, the natural language processing required, and the user interface. We evaluated query times and result quality on the full version of the English Wikipedia (40 GB XML dump) combined with the YAGO ontology (26 million facts). We have implemented a fully functional prototype based on our ideas and provide a web application to reproduce our quality experiments. Both are accessible via http://broccoli.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/repro-corr/ .},

	abstract = {We present ESTER, a modular and highly efficient system for combined full-text and ontology search. ESTER builds on a query engine that supports two basic operations: prefix search and join. Both of these can be implemented very efficiently with a compact index, yet in combination provide powerful querying capabilities. We show how ESTER can answer basic SPARQL graph-pattern queries on the ontology by reducing them to a small number of these two basic operations. ESTER further supports a natural blend of such semantic queries with ordinary full-text queries. Moreover, the prefix search operation allows for a fully interactive and proactive user interface, which after every keystroke suggests to the user possible semantic interpretations of his or her query, and speculatively executes the most likely of these interpretations. As a proof of concept, we applied ESTER to the English Wikipedia, which contains about 3 million documents, combined with the recent YAGO ontology, which contains about 2.5 million facts. For a variety of complex queries, ESTER achieves worst-case query processing times of a fraction of a second, on a single machine, with an index size of about 4 GB.},
