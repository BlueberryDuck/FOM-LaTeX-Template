	abstract = {In this paper we present a novel index data structure tailored towards semantic full-text search. Semantic full-text search, as we call it, deeply integrates keyword-based full-text search with structured search in ontologies. Queries are SPARQL-like, with additional relations for specifying word-entity co-occurrences. In order to build such queries the user needs to be guided. We believe that incremental query construction with context-sensitive suggestions in every step serves that purpose well. Our index has to answer queries and provide such suggestions in real time. We achieve this through a novel kind of posting lists and query processing, avoiding very long (intermediate) result lists and expensive (non-local) operations on these lists. In an evaluation of 8000 queries on the full English Wikipedia (40 GB XML dump) and the YAGO ontology (26.6 million facts), we achieve average query and suggestion times of around 150ms.},

	abstract = {We present Broccoli, a fast and easy-to-use search engine for what we call semantic full-text search. Semantic full-text search combines the capabilities of standard full-text search and ontology search. The search operates on four kinds of objects: ordinary words (e.g., edible), classes (e.g., plants), instances (e.g., Broccoli), and relations (e.g., occurs-with or native-to). Queries are trees, where nodes are arbitrary bags of these objects, and arcs are relations. The user interface guides the user in incrementally constructing such trees by instant (search-as-you-type) suggestions of words, classes, instances, or relations that lead to good hits. Both standard full-text search and pure ontology search are included as special cases. In this paper, we describe the query language of Broccoli, the main idea behind a new kind of index that enables fast processing of queries from that language as well as fast query suggestion, the natural language processing required, and the user interface. We evaluated query times and result quality on the full version of the English Wikipedia (40 GB XML dump) combined with the YAGO ontology (26 million facts). We have implemented a fully functional prototype based on our ideas and provide a web application to reproduce our quality experiments.
